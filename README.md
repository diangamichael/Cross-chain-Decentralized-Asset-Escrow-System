# Cross-chain-Decentralized-Asset-Escrow-System

This project aims to create a decentralized asset escrow system that leverages Arbitrum Stylus's WebAssembly (Wasm) and EVM integration. The system will enable secure, trustless escrow services across multiple blockchains, allowing users to lock assets on one chain and release them on another based on predefined conditions.

# Key Features
**Cross-Chain Asset Locking and Release:**
Uses Wasm for efficient computations to validate asset ownership and escrow terms, while EVM finalizes asset transfer and release logic.
**Multi-Language Support:**
Rust and C/C++ code handle high-performance tasks, ensuring the dApp is optimized for complex, real-time asset handling.
**Decentralized Oracle Integration:**
Integrates with oracles for off-chain data (like external price feeds) to validate cross-chain transfer terms and ensure accurate escrow conditions.
**Gas Efficiency:** 
Utilizes Wasm to reduce gas costs for escrow operations, making it more accessible for smaller transactions.
**On-Chain Dispute Resolution:**
Implements a Wasm-based dispute system, where users can raise and resolve disputes using Wasm for computational tasks and EVM for finalizing transactions.
# Project Workflow
**Escrow Creation:** 
Users initiate an escrow by specifying the assets, chains involved, and release conditions. Wasm handles computations, validating asset ownership and escrow terms.
**Asset Locking:**
Assets are locked on the initial blockchain, utilizing EVM contracts.
**Cross-Chain Validation:**
Wasm manages validations of conditions like asset value and third-party verifications, communicating with oracles and feeding data back to the smart contract.
**Asset Release or Dispute:** 
Upon meeting conditions, the asset is released to the specified account on another chain. If a dispute arises, Wasm processes the dispute logic, resolving or releasing the asset based on outcomes.
# Technical Implementation
**Arbitrum Stylus and Wasm:** 
Key operations for escrow validation and dispute processing are handled by Wasm, while EVM ensures compatibility with Ethereum assets and provides transaction finalization.
**Smart Contract Design:**
Modular contracts allow for easy updates and integration with additional blockchains, oracles, and validation services.
**Oracles and Off-Chain Data:**
Leverages decentralized oracles to fetch external conditions like asset value, feeding this information back to Wasm for processing.
**Potential Impact**
Innovation: Enables secure, decentralized asset escrow across chains, removing the need for traditional, centralized escrow services.
Technical Complexity: Combines the unique strengths of Wasm and EVM to handle cross-chain escrow, dispute resolution, and validation.
**Real-World Applications:** 
Can be used for business transactions, e-commerce, and multi-party agreements requiring cross-chain assets, adding utility to both Ethereum and Wasm-based chains.
**User Experience:**
Features a streamlined UI, allowing users to create escrows, track status, and resolve disputes with ease.
**Project Submission**
GitHub Repository: Includes the open-source code, with documentation covering setup, architecture, and integration details.
Demo Video (2-3 mins): Shows the escrow setup, asset transfer, and dispute resolution, highlighting Wasm and EVM functionalities.
This Cross-chain Decentralized Asset Escrow System leverages Arbitrum Stylus to redefine how secure asset transfers occur across blockchain networks, combining performance, security, and scalability.
